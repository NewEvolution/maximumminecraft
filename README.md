# MaximummMinecraft

MaximumMinecraft is an open source AppleScript application designed to manage multiple conflicting modded versions of the popular indie video game Minecraft.

In addition to allowing the easy use of multiple conflicting mods across the singleplayer worlds and multiplayer servers you mine, MaximumMinecraft provides many optimization options to improve your Minecraft experience on your Mac.

All features are configured via a series of interactive dialog boxes on first run, and can be enabled or disabled at will. This flexibility allows you to use MaximumMinecraft simply as a mod manager, save file backup system, memory manager, or any combination to suit your personal needs and preferences.

Fully configurable features include:
